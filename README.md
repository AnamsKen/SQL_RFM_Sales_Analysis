# Performing SQL RFM Analysis

### RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.

### In this project, I did some basic SQL analysis alongside an indept RFM analysis to help categorize our customers into 
### 'lost customer'
###  'potential churn' OR 
###  'loyal customer'  

### This project will help the marketing team discover customers to target next, offer strategic discount or let go based on their stages with our company
